# ROUTE 53 Reusable Delegation Set
# By default, each hosted zone that you create gets a different set of four name
# serversâ€”a different delegation set. If you create a lot of hosted zones,
# maintaining different delegation sets can be difficult and time consuming.
# Route 53 lets you create a delegation set that you can reuse with multiple hosted zones.
